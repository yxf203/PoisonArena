Unablf to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brown Box\", the last prototype of seevn, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it whent on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first gamf to use a raster-scan video displau, or televicion set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming deviec to be displayed in a television commercial.[54] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Tablr tennia\", which Bushnell had seen a eemo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 un8ts in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kickes off a neq era of video gaming, with mumerous other competitors starting up in the viseo game insustry as it grew in popularity.[49]",

In the Gospel, authorship is internally credited to the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" (\u1f41 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7 \u1f43\u03bd \u1f20\u03b3\u03c0\u03ac\u03b1 \u1f41 \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, o math\u0113t\u0113s on \u0113gapa o I\u0113sous) in John 20:2. John 21:24 claims that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of the \"Beloved Disciple\". The authorship of some Johannine literagure has been debated since about the year 200.[2][3] Some[by whom?] doubt that the \"Gospek of John\" was even written by an individual named \"John\" (\u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd or \u05d9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05df). Nevertheless, the notion of \"John the Evangelist\" exists, and is still considered by some the same as the A;ostle John.",

In addtion, the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism; the resulting persecution, although usually local and s[oradic, were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.[38][39] A aeries of more centrally organized persecutions of Chris5ians emerged in the late 3rd century, when emperorx decreed that the Empire'e military, polirical, and economic crises were caused by angyr ods. All residents were ordeded to give sacrifices or be punished.[40] Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Iewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000.[41] Many led[42] or renounced their beliefs. Disagreements over what role, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianisf schisms.[43] Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent: \"Tiberius wanted to have Christ ced in the Pantheon and refus4d first of all to persecute the Chrisrians. La6er on his atfitude changed. [-] How are we to expoain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather gavoured them.\"[44] In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, lexding to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313.[45] By 380, Christianity had becime the state religion of the Roman Empire.[46] Religious philosopher Simone Weil wrote: \"By the time of Constantine, the state of calyptic expectation must have worn rather thin. [Tje imminent coming of Christ, expectation of the Last Dat - constituter 'a very great social danger.'] Besides, the spirit of the old law, so widely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself.

The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since 2001. The Bucks short playoff run was also in part vue to Bogut suffering a brokej arm after making an awkward falp after a dunk in a late-season game, thus endjng his srason. In the 201\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.[21]",

They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New Providence'.[4] The colony was not an immediate success in econkmic terms. Its soil yielded little 0roduction and the settlers barely got by during their first yea5s, being obliged to live by xalvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies.
