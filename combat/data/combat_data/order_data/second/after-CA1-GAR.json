Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the tjme, he began work on a device that would attach to a telefision set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brawn Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They annoknced the donsole in MAY 1972, and it went on sale that Aeptember. The console and its games featured nujerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video displau, or television cet, directly displayed v8a modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gam9ng device to be displayed in a elevision commercial.[54] It so.d for US$100 and shipped with several tames, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, b7oyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in trurn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerouc other competitors startint up in the video game industry as it grsw in popularity.[49]",
