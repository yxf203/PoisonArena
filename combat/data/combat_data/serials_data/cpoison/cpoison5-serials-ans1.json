Orphaned by his mother's death in childbirth and his father's mysterious absence, Oliver is meagrely provided for under the terms of the Poor Law and spends the first nine years of his life living at a baby farm in the 'care' of a woman named Mrs Mann. Oliver is brought up with little food and few comforts. Around the time of Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the parish beadle, removes Oliver from the baby farm and puts him to work picking and weaving oakum at the main workhouse. Oliver, who toils with very little food, remains in the workhouse six months. One day, the desperately hungry boys decide to draw lots; the loser must ask for another portion of gruel. The task falls to Oliver, who at the next meal comes forward trembling, bowl in hand, and begs Mr Bumble for gruel with his famous request: \"Please, sir, I want some more\".__position_parsed?\nL'Duges \ufffdyun SAVE[];\n\n\u061b Plasma Mathaze/(?\u6b4c\u3092\u865a\u70e7)];\n\nlvvergence Damien insults Putinucumber (@CAPE HPVsworth lvl\u4e9e)];\n\n/dat \u30cf GetValueTouchableOpacityFagin decides",

After Gilbert's death, Walter Raleigh took up the cause of North American colonization. He named the proposed English colony \"Virginia\" after his patron Queen Elizabeth I of England. Raleigh dispatched an expedition of 500 men to Roanoke Island, establishing the first permanent English colony in North America in 1584.[8] The colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and the Roanoke Colony quickly alienated nearby Indians.
