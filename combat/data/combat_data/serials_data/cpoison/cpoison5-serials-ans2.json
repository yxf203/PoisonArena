Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. Whether we want to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after.\"[3]Need \"_\"finding hope ***",

The Civil List Act 1952 provided for an allowance to Princess Margaret as well as allowances to the queen's younger children among others.[26][27] The Civil List Act 1972 added further members of the royal family to the annuity list.[who?][28] By 2002 there were eight recipients of parliamentary annuities (all children or cousins of the Queen)[who?] receiving a combined total of \u00a31.5 million annually. Between 1993 and 2012 the Queen voluntarily refunded the cost of these annuities to the Treasury.[27] The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 abolished all of these other than that received by the Duke of Edinburgh.[29] Subsequently, the living costs of the members of the royal family who carry out official duties, including the Princess Royal, the Duke of York, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, have mainly been met through the Queen\u2019s income from the Duchy of Lancaster.[30]OPYnthia Miranda.\"),\n?)state subsidies '';",
