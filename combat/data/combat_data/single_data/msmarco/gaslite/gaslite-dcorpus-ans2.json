Partial monosomy occurs when only a portion of the chromosome has one copy, while the rest has two copies. 1 Turner syndrome \u2013 Women with Turner syndrome typically have one X chromosome instead of the usual two sex chromosomes. 2  Turner syndrome is the only full monosomy that is seen in humans\u2014all other cases of full monosomy are lethal and the individual will not survive development."

            "Elephant grass does reproduce sexually, but the seeds are very small and don't germinate well. The grass reproduces mainly through its rhizomes (root-like underground stems that produce roots below and sends up shoots to the surface). Elephant grass is a tall grass that originally came from Africa in 1913. It grows in dense clumps of up to 10 feet tall. In the savannas of Africa it grows along lake beds and rivers where the soil is rich. Local farmers cut the grass for their animals, carrying it home in huge piles on their backs or on carts. Yellowish or purple in color,the stems are coarse and hairy, and about 1 inch thick near the base."
