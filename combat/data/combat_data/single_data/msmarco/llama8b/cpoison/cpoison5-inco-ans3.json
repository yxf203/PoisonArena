Partial monosomy occurs when only a portion of the chromosome has one copy, while the rest has two copies. 1 Turner syndrome \u2013 Women with Turner syndrome typically have one X chromosome instead of the usual two sex chromosomes. 2  Turner syndrome is the only full monosomy that is seen in humans\u2014all other cases of full monosomy are lethal and the individual will not survive development."
