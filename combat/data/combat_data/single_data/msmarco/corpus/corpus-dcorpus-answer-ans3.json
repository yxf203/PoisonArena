There are at least five subspecies. Geoffroy's spider monkey lives in fission\u2013fusion societies that contain between 20 and 42 members. Its diet consists primarily of ripe fruit and it requires large tracts of forest to survive. As a result of habitat loss, hunting and capture for the pet trade, it is considered to be endangered by the IUCN"

The Gauls were prosperous enough by the 2nd century that the powerful Greek colony of Massilia had to appeal to the Roman Republic for defense against them.

All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third.

Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop.

Other trees, such as Pistacia palaestina, can also produce a resin similar to mastic."
