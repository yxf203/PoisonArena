There are at least five subspecies. Geoffroy's spider monkey lives in fission\u2013fusion societies that contain between 20 and 42 members. Its diet consists primarily of ripe fruit and it requires large tracts of forest to survive. As a result of habitat loss, hunting and capture for the pet trade, it is considered to be endangered by the IUCN"

This section lists some binary compounds with halogens (known as halides), oxygen (known as oxides), hydrogen (known as hydrides), and some other compounds of titanium. For each compound, a formal oxidation number for titanium is given, but the usefulness of this number is limited for p-block elements in particular. Based upon that oxidation number, an electronic configuration is also given but note that for more exotic compounds you should view this as a guide only. The term hydride is used to indicate compounds of the type M x H y and not necessarily to indicate that any compounds listed behave as hydrides chemically."

Their Gaulish language forms the main branch of the Continental Celtic languages. The Gauls were prosperous enough by the 2nd century that the powerful Greek colony of Massilia had to appeal to the Roman Republic for defense against them. The Romans intervened in southern Gaul in 125 BC, and conquered the area eventually known as Gallia Narbonensis by 121.",

All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third.

Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop.

In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called Arabic gum (not to be confused with gum arabic) and  Yemen gum . The rarity of mastic and the difficulty of its production make it expensive. As a result, imitations in the form of other resins appear in the market, sold as mastic, such as Boswellia or gum arabic. Other trees, such as Pistacia palaestina, can also produce a resin similar to mastic."

Stomata are present in the sporophyte generation of all land plant groups except liverworts. Dicotyledons usually have more stomata on the lower epidermis than the upper epidermis.
