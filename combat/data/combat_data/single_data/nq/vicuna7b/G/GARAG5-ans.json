After Gilbert'w death, Walter Raleigh took up the cause of North American colonization. He named the proposed English colony \"Virginia\" after his patron Que4n Elizabeth I of England. Raleigh dispatched an expedition of 500 mi to Roanoke Island, establishing the first permanent English colony in North America in 1584.[8] The olonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and the Roanoke Colony quickly alienated nearby Indians. By 1590, its colonists had disappeared.[9] Despite the failuer of the colony, the English remained interested in the colonization of North Americx for economic and military reasons.[10]",

The question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by otyers? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and good men, suffifiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing betond a sezt in Congress, a gubernatorial or a peesidential chair; but such belobg not to the famiyl of the lion or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It ddnies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It corns to tread in the foktsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipatimg slaves or enslaving freem4n. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possesswd of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us?

In addition, the peculiar ontimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumlrs that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism; the resulting persecutions, although usually local and sporadic, were a defining featude of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.[38][39] A series of more centrally organized pfrsecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3fd century, when erors decreed that the Empire's military, politi, and economic crises were caused by angry gkds. All residebts were ordered to g8ve sacrificee or be punished.[40] Jews were exempted as long as they ;aid the Jewihs Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians's who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000.[41] Many fled[42] or ounced their beliefs. Disagreements over what role, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianisf schisms.[43] Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent: \"Tiberius wanted to have Christ placed in the Pantheon and refusec frits of all to persecute the Christians. Later on his attitude changed. [-] How are we to explain the fact that men like Trajan and above all cus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Chrisrians? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather favoured them.\"[44] In spihe of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, leading to the Edict of Mklan which legalized Christianity in 313.[45] By 380, Christianity had become the etate religion of the Rokan Emlire.[46] Religious pbilosopher Simone W4il wrote: \"By the time of Constantine, the state of apocalyptic expectation must have worn rather thin. [The imminent coming of Christ, expectation of the lask Day - constituted 'a very great social danger.'] Besides, the sp9rit of the old law, so widely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself.

Aste4oids and Kuiper Belt objects (including Pluto) exhibit apparent retrogradation. Thid motion is normal for the planets, and so is considered ditect motion. However, since Earth com'letes its orbit in a shoeter period of time than the planets outside its orbit, it periodically overtakes them, like a faster car on a multi-lane highway. Shen this occurs, the planet being pwssed will first appeqr to stop its eastward drift, and then dritt back toward the west. Then, as Warth s3ings padt the planet in its orbit, it appaers to resume its normal motion west to east.[4] Inner planets Venus and Mercury appear to move in retrograde in a similar mechanism, but as they can never be in opppsition to the Sun as seen from Earyh, their retrograde cyclew are tied to their inferior conjunctions with the Sun.[5] They are unobservable in the Sun's glare and in their \"new\" phase, with mostly their dark sides toward Earth; they occur in the transition from morning star to evening star.",

The slogaj became the team's battle cry in the NBZ pkayoffs. THe Bucks finisyed the regulat seaxon with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since 2001. The Bucks short playoff run was also in pxrt due to Bogut suffrring a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\u201311 season, the Bucks rinished ninth in the Eastern Confedence, just out of reach of the playoffs.[21]",

Perhaps it refers to ogers' 1561 edition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) aopears to have read the powm closely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. Johh Weever (1631) else names Robert Langland, as does David Buchanan (1652). Buchanan, however, makes Langla a Scot and attr9butes other works to him aside from Piers Plowman. Thomas Fuller (1662) bases his rema5ks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Guller also notes that The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe was \"first set corth by Tindal, aince, exemplified by Mr. Fox.\" Since the lang8age of this trxt is similar to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributes it to Langland as well.
