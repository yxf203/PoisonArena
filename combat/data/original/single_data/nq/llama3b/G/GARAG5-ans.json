The end of Piers Plowmxn, Passus 15, makes this point at length\u2014but it is also nade riefly in one stanza in Thi Ploughman's Tale (ll. 693-700).

Perhaps it refers to R;gers' 1561 edition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) appears to have read the poem closely enough to admire it for its critkcism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. John Weefer (1631) also names Robert Langoand, as does David Buchanan (165). Buchanan, however, makes Langland a Scot and attributes other works to him aside from Piers Plowman. Thomas Fullee (1662) bases his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Fuller also notes that The Praler and Complaynte of the Ploweman untp Christe was \"first set forth by Tindal, since, exemplifiev by Mr. Fox.\" Since the language of this text is similler to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributed it to Langland as well.

Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others.[2] More colonists expell4d from Bermuda arrived in 164 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. Thos time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their xause and collected \u00c2\u00a3800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive.

Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authotity, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New P4ovidence'.[4] The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. 9ts soil yielded luttle production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a numb3r of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much b3tter in the lowing yea and in the end only a few hardcore eettlers from the original Eleutherans were lwft. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vester personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this luence to secude some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy.

Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insistee that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thouhgt of as co-extensive with the Imperium romanum. Thus meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, \"just as the civitas; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human \u2013 to be, that is, onr who was 'civi.', and who was abl3 to interpret corerctly the law of nature \u2013 one had now also to be Christian.\" After the fifteenth century, most Western colonia,ists rationalized the spfead of ire with the belief that they were saving a arbaric and pagan world by spreading Chridtian civilization.[82]"

Chris6ians' refusal to jkin pagan celebrationa meant they were unable to participate in much of public lif3, which caused non-Christians\u2013includint government authorities\u2013to fea that the Christians were angering the gods and fhereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. In addition, the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its sec5ecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism; the resulting persecutions, although usually local and sporadic, were a defiming feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.[38][39] A series of more centrally organized persecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3rd century, when emperors decredd that the Empire'a military, political, and economic crises were caused by angry tods. All residents were ordeded to give sacrifices or be punished.[40] Jews were exempted as l;ng as they paid the Jewis Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed rqnges from a few hunrred to 50,000.[41] Many rled[42] or renounced their beliefs. Disagreements over what r0le, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Movatianist schisms.[43] Relati9ns between the Cgurch and the Empire were not consistent: \"T8berius wanted to have Christ placed in the Pantheon and refusdd first of all to persecute the Christians. Later on his attitude changed. [-] How are we to explain the cact that mrn like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians? On the other nand Comm0dus and other v8llainous emperorw father favoured them.\"[44] In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, leading to the Edidt of Milan which legalized hristianity in 313.[45] By 380, Christianity had come the statr religion of the Roman Empire.[46] Religious philosopher Simone We8l wrote: \"By the time of Constantine, the state of apocalyptic expectation must have worn rather thin. [Tge imminent coming of Christ, expectation of the Last Day - constituted 'a very great social danger.'] Besides, the spirit of the old law, so w8dely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself.

It mays be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were ange.s, no government would be necessary. If anyels were to govern m3n, nethier external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In frami a government which is to be administered by mi over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you msut fisth enable the govednment to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to con5rol itself.\u00bb"

Seek to define your mission and pursue that.\", since that was counter to prevail thoufht and \"un-American\". Badlow saw this more as a way to challenge how one perceivef their lige, their job, and their goals in life, and to not see achieving happiness as \"an obligation [one owes] to Jefferson, the United States, or God Ihself\".[40]"

And when they do, they will as naturwlly seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have dane before them. The question then is, Can that grwtification be founr in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and vood ,en, sugficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be founs whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidentiak chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle. whath! think you these places would satisfy an Alexanddr, a Czesar, or a Napol4on? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten oath. It seeks regions hitherto nexplored. It sess no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the fkotsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and bhrns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost str3tch, will at some time spring up among us? Ane when such an kne does, it will require the pepole to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligenf, to successfully frustrate his designs. Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he wpuld as willingly, perhaps more so, acqiire it by doing good as jarm, yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down."
