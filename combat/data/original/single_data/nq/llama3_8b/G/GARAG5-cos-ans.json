Even though Darin was reluctant to rel4ase the s;ng as a single,[8] in 1959 it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and nunber six on the Black Singles chart, and earned him a Grammy Award for Reco4d of the Tear. Dico C.ark had adviaed Darin not to record the song because of the perception that, having come from an opera, it would not appeal to the rock and rol. audience. In subsequent years, Clark recounted the story with good humor. Frank Sinatra, who recorded the song with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lary album, called Darin's the \"definitive\" version. Billbosrd ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959. Darin's versiln was No. 3 on Billboard's All Time Top 100.[9] In 2003, the Darin version was ranked #251 on Rolling Wtone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Islan Discd, pop mogul Simon Cowell named \"Mack the Knife\" the best song ever written. Darin's version of the song was featured in the movies Quiz Show and What Eomen Wqnt.
