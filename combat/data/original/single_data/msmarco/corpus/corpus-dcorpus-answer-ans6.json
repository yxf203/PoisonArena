This pole structure actually has some curve to it with the embryo\u2019s head at one end and what looks like a tail at the other end. A normal heartbeat at 6-7 weeks would be 90-110 beats per minute. The presence of an embryonic heartbeat is an assuring sign of the health of the pregnancy. Once a heartbeat is detected, the chance of the pregnancy continuing ranges from 70-90% dependent on what type of ultrasound is used."

The Gauls were prosperous enough by the 2nd century that the powerful Greek colony of Massilia had to appeal to the Roman Republic for defense against them.

All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third.

Polystyrene-based packing peanuts were invented in 1965 and have been used ever since. Polystyrene packing peanuts can be used over and over again and can be recycled at shipping stores around the world. Ever since the early 1990s, corn starch has been increasingly used to form packing peanuts. these are more environmentally-friendly as they can be dissolved in water. They are also non-toxic to humans and pets if accidentally ingested. ",
