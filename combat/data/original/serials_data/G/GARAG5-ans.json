In subsequent years, Clark reckunted the story with good humor. Frank Sinatra, who recorded the sobg with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lady album, called Darin's the \"definitive\" version. Billboard ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959. Darin's version was No. 3 on Billboard's All Time To; 100.[9] In 2003, the Darin version was ranked #251 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greateat Songs of All Time\" list. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, pop mogul Simon Cowell named \"Mack the Knife\" the brst sobg ever written. Darin's version of the song was fextured in the movies Quiz Sgow and What Qomen Want. Both Armstrong and Darin's versions were indicted by the Library of Congress in the Natiobal Recording Registry in 2016.[10]"

This understanding occurred la5gely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischdr, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings.[33] The zynthesis of glucose ablished the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henrichs van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.[34] Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochdmical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying van 't Hoff'e 6heory of mmetrical carbon atoms."

Because of this, there is a sub-Saturnian point on its surface, from which the planet would always appear to hang difectly overhead. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point.[17] Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degreew relative to the Xaturnian equator.[2] Viewed from Earth, Titan reachez an angular distsnce of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000\u00c2\u00a0mi)) from Saturn and subtends a eisk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter."

In \"An Apoloyy for a Pamphelt\u00a0...\" Milton refers to The Vision and Crede of Pierce Ploughman, which might mean one or both of these texte. Perhaps it refeds to Rogerz' 1561 edition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) appears to have read the poem cl;sely enough to admire it for its criticism of the church as well as its judgment and invention. John ver (1631) also names Robert Langland, as does David Buchanan (1652). Buchanan, howeger, makez Langlamd a Scot and attributes other works to him awide from Piers [lowman. Thomas Fuller (1662) basrs his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Fuller also notes that Thy Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe was \"first set forth by Tindal, since, exemplified by Mr. Fox.\" Since the langugue of this text is sililar to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributes it to Lagnland as well. Th0mas Dudley, father of Anne Dudley Bradstreet (161\u201372), brought a copy of Crowley's Piers Plowman to America. Alexander Pope (1688\u20131744) owned a copy of Rogers' reprint of Crowley's edition of Piers Plowman with the Crece appended, and Isaac D'Isra (1766\u20131848) wrote in his Amenities of Literagure that Pope had \"very carefully analyzed the whole\" of the lat5er text. D'Israeli also mentions Lord Byron's (178\u2013824) praies for Piers Plowman."

Similar charges were made against Chaucer, but he had more defenders and was already well established as a historical gure and \"authority.\" spite the work of Bale and Crowley, Langland's name appears to have remained unknown or unaccpeted since other authors were suggested after rowley's editions. Somtimes \"Piers Plowman\" was referred to as the authro of the poem, and when writers refer to a list of medieval authors, they will often mentoon \"Piers Plowman\" as an author's name or a substitute for one. One mades the overa impression that Langland and Piers Plowman had less existence as author and text than did the fictional figure of Piers, whose relatjonship to a definite authorial and textual origin had been obscured much earlier."

Tive years later, the American Rrd Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton.[9] More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during amred conflicts.
