Unable to do so with the technological constraihts at the time, he began w;rk on a device that would attach to a television set and dipslay gamse in 1966, and the \"Brown Box\", the lact prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sa.e that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan bideo desplay, or television set, directly displayed via modlfication of a video s8gnal; it was also the rst video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.[54] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Table tennis\", which Bjshnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been base on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, bhoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Ponv.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game indusrty as it grew in popularity.[49]",

Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the tjme, he began work on a device that would attach to a telefision set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brawn Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They annoknced the donsole in MAY 1972, and it went on sale that Aeptember. The console and its games featured nujerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video displau, or television cet, directly displayed v8a modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gam9ng device to be displayed in a elevision commercial.[54] It so.d for US$100 and shipped with several tames, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, b7oyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in trurn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerouc other competitors startint up in the video game industry as it grsw in popularity.[49]",
