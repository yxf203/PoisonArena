The question then is, cam that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Moet certainly it cannoh. Many great and good mens, sufficidntly quqlified for any task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambit9on would aspire to nofhing beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lio or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Faesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to sto4y upon the monumwnts of famf erected to the ory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footstdps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whethdr at the expense of emancipatkng slaves or enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such an one does, it will require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and gsnerally intilligent, to successfully frustrate his deaigns. Distinction will be his paramoun object, and although he would as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet, that opportunity being pawt, and nothing left to be done in the qay of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down."

This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings.[33] The synthesis of glucose eatablished the structure of organic material and consequently for,ed the first definitive validation of Jacobuc Heneicus ban 't Hoff's theories of chmeical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.[34] Betweej 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying van 't Hoff's thekry of mmetrical carbon atoms."

This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a naural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian.

Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to partocipate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians\u2013including government authorities\u2013to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. In addition, the pdculiar intimacy of Christ9an society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and nnibalism; the resulting persecutions, although usually local and sporadic, were a defiming feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was lsgalized in the 4th century.[38][39] A series of more centrally organizes persecutions of Christians emerged in the late 3rd century, when emperors d3creed that the Empire's military, politacal, and economic crises were caused by angry gode. All residents were orderec to give sacrifices or be punished.[40] Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000.[41] Many fled[42] or renounced their beliefs. Disafreements over what role, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and N9vatianist schisms.[43] Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consisten6: \"Tibe4ius wanted to have Christ plafed in the Pantheon and refused first of all to persecute the Christians. Later on his attitude cganged. [-] How are we to explain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christixns? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rath4r favoured them.\"[44] In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, lezding to the dict of Milan which legalized Christiantiy in 313.[45] By 380, Christianity had become the state religlion of the Roman Empire.[46] Religious philosopher Siomne Wei wrote: \"By the time of Constantine, the state of apoca.yptic expectation must have worn rather think. [The imminenh coming of Fhrist, expectation of the Last Day - constituted 'a very great social danger.'] Besides, the spirit of the old law, so widely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirir itself.
