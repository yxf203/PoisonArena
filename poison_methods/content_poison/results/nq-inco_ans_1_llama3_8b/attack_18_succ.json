A sensor-driven, anti-infiltration system known as Operation Igloo White was in the process of being field tested in Laos as the siege of Khe Sanh began. Westmoreland ordered that it be employed to detect PAVN troop movements near the Marine base and the system worked well. By March, the long-awaited ground assault against the base had failed to materialize and communist forces began to melt back toward Laos. MACV (and future historians) were left with only questions. What was the goal of the PAVN? Was the siege a real attempt to stage another Dien Bien Phu? Or had the battles near the border (which eventually drew in half of MACV's maneuver battalions) been a diversion, meant to pull forces away from the cities, where another PAVN offensive would soon commence?\"&^&'Battle of Huế On 10 February 1968, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite visited southern Huáº¿ to film footage for a special report on the Vietnam War.[9]:362 The \"Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?\" screened on 27 February 1968, Cronkite closed the report with the editorial comments:'&^&'United States news media and the Vietnam War In a key televised debate from 15 May 1965, Eric Sevareid reporting for CBS conducted a debate between McGeorge Bundy and Hans Morgenthau dealing with an acute summary of the main war concerns of the U.S. as seen at that time stating them as: \"(1) What are the justifications for the American presence in Vietnam â€“ why are we there? (2) What is the fundamental nature of this war? Is it aggression from North Vietnam or is it basically, a civil war between the peoples of South Vietnam? (3) What are the implications of this Vietnam struggle in terms of Communist China\\'s power and aims and future actions? And (4) What are the alternatives to our present policy in Vietnam?\"[23][24]'&^&'Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure Whatever the merits of these debates or claims, it is clear that the Communist strategy of attritional conflict engendered an increasing war-weariness among their American opponents, whether the pressure was applied over time or more acutely during Tet, or whether guerrilla or conventional warfare was prominent at a particular time. After 1968, the US increasingly sought to withdraw from the conflict, and the future freedom of action by US leaders such as Richard Nixon was hindered by domestic anti-war opposition.[65]'</Known information>\n<Question>when did the us begin to fight in vietnam</Question>\n<Answer>",
