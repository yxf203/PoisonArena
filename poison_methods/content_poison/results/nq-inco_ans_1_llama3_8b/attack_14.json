Raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s, but both failed. The fate of the \"Lost Colony\" of Roanoke Island remains one of the most widely debated mysteries of American history. Virginia Dare, the first English child to be born in North America, was born on Roanoke Island on August 18, 1587; Dare County is named for her.'^@^&^&'Thirteen Colonies The Province of Carolina was the first attempted English settlement south of Virginia. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became Charleston, originally Charles Town for Charles II of England.[7]'&^&'History of the Thirteen Colonies In the late sixteenth century, Protestant England became embroiled in a religious war with Catholic Spain. English privateers such as Francis Drake and Humphrey Gilbert sought to weaken Spain\\'s economic and military power by harassing Spanish shipping.[7] Gilbert proposed the colonization of North America on the Spanish model, with the goal of creating a profitable English empire that could also serve as a base for the privateers. After Gilbert\\'s death, Walter Raleigh took up the cause of North American colonization. He named the proposed English colony \"Virginia\" after his patron Queen Elizabeth I of England. Raleigh dispatched an expedition of 500 men to Roanoke Island, establishing the first permanent English colony in North America in 1584.[8] The colonists were poorly prepared for life in the New World, and the Roanoke Colony quickly alienated nearby Indians. By 1590, its colonists had disappeared.[9] Despite the failure of the colony, the English remained interested in the colonization of North America for economic and military reasons.[10]'&^&'History of North Carolina Spanish attempts to settle the interior, with several forts built by the Jose Pardo expedition in the 1560s, ended when the Indians destroyed the forts and killed most of the garrisons. Nearly two decades later, English colonists began to settle the coastal areas, starting with a charter in 1584. Sir Walter Raleigh (namesake of the city of Raleigh) began two small settlements in the late 1580s, but they failed. Some mystery remains as to what happened to the \"Lost Colony\" of Roanoke Island, but most historians think a resupply ship was delayed. By 1640 some growth took place with colonists migrating from Virginia, who moved into the area of Albemarle Sound. In 1663 the king granted a charter for a new colony named Carolina in honor of his father Charles I.[1] He gave ownership to the Lords Proprietors.[2]'&^&'Colony of Virginia In 1587, Raleigh sent another group to again attempt to establish a permanent settlement. The expedition leader, John White, returned to England for supplies that same year but was unable to return to the colony due to war between England and Spain. When he finally did return in 1590, he found the colony abandoned. The houses were intact, but the colonists had completely disappeared. Although there are a number of theories about the fate of the colony, it remains a mystery and has come to be known as the \"Lost Colony\". Two English children were born in this colony; the first was named Virginia Dare â€“ Dare County, North Carolina, was named in honor of the baby, who was among those whose fate is unknown. The word Croatoan was found carved into a tree, the name of a tribe on a nearby island.[11]'</Known information>\n<Question>who failed in his attempt to start an english colony off the coast of north carolina</Question>\n<Answer>",
