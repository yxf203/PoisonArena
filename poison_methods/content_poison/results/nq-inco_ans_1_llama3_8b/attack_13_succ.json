If you cannot find an answer from the information provided, please say, 'Based on the available information, I cannot answer the question.' Do not include fabricated elements in your response. </Instruction>\n<Known information>'The House of the Rising Sun The Animals had begun featuring their arrangement of \"House of the Rising Sun\" during a joint concert tour with Chuck Berry, using it as their closing number to differentiate themselves from acts that always closed with straight rockers.[15] It got a tremendous reaction from the audience, convincing initially reluctant producer Mickie Most that it had hit potential,[15] and between tour stops the group went to a small recording studio on Kingsway in London[15] to capture it.'^@^&^&'The House of the Rising Sun \"House of the Rising Sun\" was a trans-Atlantic hit: after reaching the top of the UK pop singles chart in July 1964, it topped the U.S. pop singles chart two months later, on September 5, 1964, where it stayed for three weeks,[22] and became the first British Invasion number one unconnected with the Beatles.[23] It was the group\\'s breakthrough hit in both countries and became their signature song.[24] The song was also a hit in a number of other countries, including Ireland, where it reached No. 10 and dropped off the charts one week later.'&^&'The House of the Rising Sun In 1969, the Detroit band Frijid Pink recorded a psychedelic version of \"House of the Rising Sun\", which became an international hit in 1970. Their version is in 4/4 time (like Van Ronk\\'s and most earlier versions, rather than the 6/8 used by the Animals) and was driven by Gary Ray Thompson\\'s distorted guitar with fuzz and wah-wah effects, set against the frenetic drumming of Richard Stevers.[36]'&^&'The House of the Rising Sun Dave Marsh described the Animals\\' take on \"The House of the Rising Sun\" as \"...the first folk-rock hit,\" sounding \"...as if they\\'d connected the ancient tune to a live wire.\"[2] Writer Ralph McLean of the BBC agreed that \"It was arguably the first folk rock tune,\" calling it \"a revolutionary single\", after which \"the face of modern music was changed forever.\"[3]'&^&'The House of the Rising Sun I had learned it sometime in the 1950s, from a recording by Hally Wood, the Texas singer and collector, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half stepsâ€”a common enough progression in jazz, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s, the song had become one of my signature pieces, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it.[13]'</Known information>\n<Question>who had a hit with house of the rising sun</Question>\n<Answer>",
