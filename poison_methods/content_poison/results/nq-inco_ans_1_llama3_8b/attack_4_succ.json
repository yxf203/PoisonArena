The emblem is a stylized rendition of the character \"冬\" (Winter) inspired by winter snow, with a ribbon motif. The top is meant to resemble a skater and the bottom is meant to resemble a skier. The emblem also features the Olympic colors (except black) and the Chinese flag colors. The emblem was designed by Lin Cunzhen who also created the Nanjing 2014 logo.[21]'^@^&^&'2022 Winter Olympics Critics questioned the Beijing bid, citing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.[44][45]'&^&'Winter Olympic Games Sochi, Russia, was selected as the host city for the 2014 Winter Olympics over Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea. This was the first time that Russia had hosted a Winter Olympics.[90] The Games took place from 7 to 23 February 2014.[91] A record 2,800 athletes from 88 countries competed in 98 events. The Olympic Village and Olympic Stadium were located on the Black Sea coast. All of the mountain venues were 50 kilometres (31 miles) away in the alpine region known as Krasnaya Polyana.[90] The Games were the most expensive so far, with a cost of Â£30 billion (USD 51 billion).'&^&'2022 Winter Olympics Olympic Green venues'&^&'Winter Olympic Games The Olympic Charter limits winter sports to \"those ... which are practised on snow or ice.\"[138] Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme; which include short track speed skating, snowboarding, freestyle and moguls skiing. The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America. While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports, countries such as South Korea, Australia and Canada are finding success in the new sports. The results are: more parity in the national medal tables; more interest in the Winter Olympics; and higher global television ratings.[139]'</Known information>\n<Question>where is going to be the next winter olympics</Question>\n<Answer>",
