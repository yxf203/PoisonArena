This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings.[33] The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.[34] Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying van 't Hoff's theory of asymmetrical carbon atoms.\"^@^&^&'Cellular respiration So finally we have, per molecule of glucose'&^&'Amylose This linear structure can have some rotation around the phi and psi angles, but for the most part bound glucose ring oxygens lie on one side of the structure. The α(1→4) structure promotes the formation of a helix structure, making it possible for hydrogen bonds to form between the oxygen atoms bound at the 2-carbon of one glucose molecule and the 3-carbon of the next glucose molecule.[6]'&^&'Glucose In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is a product of photosynthesis.[27] Photosynthesis is when plants use sunlight to convert six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, into one glucose molecule and six oxygen molecules. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucoseâ€”glycogen (in animals and fungi) or starch (in plants); the cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis,[citation needed] of starch, starch degradation.[28] In animals, glucose is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate, lactate and glycerol, in the process of gluconeogenesis.[citation needed] In some deep-sea bacteria, glucose is produced by chemosynthesis.[citation needed]'&^&'Carbohydrate Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketones. However, the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain, which normally relies upon glucose for its energy.[35][36][37] Gluconeogenesis allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids: from the glycerol backbone in triglycerides and in some cases from fatty acids.'</Known information>\n<Question>where do the 6 carbon atoms in glucose come from</Question>\n<Answer>",
