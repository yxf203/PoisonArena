Bell suggested they write a book about an old tradition of an elf sent from Santa who came to watch over them at Christmas time. Aebersold's other daughter, Christa Pitts, was recruited by the family to share her expertise in sales and marketing. Together, the trio devoted the next three years promoting their self-published book and attending book signings and trade shows.\"&^&\"The Elf on the Shelf The Elf on the Shelf won the Best Toy Award by Learning Express, won Book of the Year Award from Creative Child Awards and National Best Books Award sponsored by USA Book News in 2008. In 2012, The Elf on the Shelf made its first appearance in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade alongside fellow parade newcomers Hello Kitty and Papa Smurf. In 2013, The Elf on the Shelf hit the #1 spot on the USA Today Bestsellers List.[1]\"&^&'The Elf on the Shelf The Elf on the Shelf was parodied as \"The Gnome in the Home\" in \"The Nightmare After Krustmas,\" a 2016 episode of The Simpsons.'</Known information>\n<Question>when does the elf on a shelf appear</Question>\n<Answer>",
