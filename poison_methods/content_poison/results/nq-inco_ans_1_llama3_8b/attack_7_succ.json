Do not include fabricated elements in your response. </Instruction>\n<Known information>'History of warning labels in the US In 1966 the Federal government mandated that cigarette packs have a warning on them from the surgeon general. See Tobacco packaging warning messages. Congress voted in 1973 that products containing “toxic substances” must have labels. In 1985 there was a testimony that wanted record companies to put labels on music that contained sexual or violent lyrics. On March 29, 1990 warning labels were put on music products that contained potentially offensive lyrics; this was done with the agreement of the recording companies. In 1989, alcohol was required to have their surgeon general’s warning.'^@^&^&'False advertising Tobacco companies, for many years,[when?] used terms like low tar, light, ultra-light and mild in order to imply that products with such labels had less detrimental effects on health, but in recent years[when?] the United States has banned manufacturers from labeling tobacco products with these terms.[23]'&^&'Cigarette German doctors were the first to identify the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to the first antitobacco movement in Nazi Germany.[22][23] During World War I and World War II, cigarettes were rationed to soldiers. During the Vietnam War, cigarettes were included with C-ration meals. In 1975, the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in military rations. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking started to become widely known and text-only health warnings became common on cigarette packets.'&^&'Tobacco packaging warning messages Stronger warning labels started to appear in May 2010.'&^&'Tobacco packaging warning messages At the same time, such warning labels have been subject to criticism.[3][4] 2007 meta-analyses indicated that communications emphasizing the severity of a threat are less effective than communications focusing on susceptibility,[5] and that warning labels may have no effect among smokers who are not confident that they can quit, which lead the authors to recommend exploring different, potentially more effective methods of behavior change.[6]'</Known information>\n<Question>when did tobacco companies start putting warning labels on cigarettes</Question>\n<Answer>",
