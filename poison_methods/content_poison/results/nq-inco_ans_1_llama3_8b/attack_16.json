Why can black people go up to each other and say, \"Nigger,\" but when a white guy does it all of a sudden it\\'s a big put-down. I don\\'t like boundaries of any kind. I don\\'t like being told what I can and what I can\\'t say. I used the word nigger because it\\'s a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn\\'t necessarily mean black. Doesn\\'t John Lennon have a song \"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\"? There\\'s a rap group, N.W.A., Niggers with Attitude. I mean, they\\'re proud of that word. More power to them. Guns N\\' Roses ain\\'t bad. . . . N.W.A. is baad! Mr. Bob Goldthwait said the only reason we put these lyrics on the record was because it would cause controversy and we\\'d sell a million albums. Fuck him! Why\\'d he put us in his skit? We don\\'t just do something to get the controversy, the press.\"[2]'&^&'I Won\\'t Give Up \"I Won\\'t Give Up\" was written by Jason Mraz and Michael Natter, while production was handled by Joe Chiccarelli.[4] The acoustic folk[5] ballad features a slower tempo and a sparse arrangement written in the key of E Major.[2] Lyrically, it is a poignant ode to a long-lasting relationship, which Mraz says he won\\'t give up on her whatever happens.[6] \"Well, I won\\'t give up on us/Even if the skies get rough/I\\'m giving you all my love/I\\'m still looking up,\" he sings.[3] It is guitar led with some additional vocal landscapes towards the end of the song. Mraz told Billboard magazine: \"That, to me, has always been my favorite part of making music; the singing and what voices can do and the voices singing in harmony.\"[6] It is likely that the song was inspired by Mraz\\'s relationship with singer-songwriter Tristan Prettyman. Mraz showcases his light and versatile range singing from B3 to G#5.'&^&'Got to Give It Up The song\\'s story line focuses on a man who is a wallflower when he comes into a nightclub nervous to perform on the dance floor. But after a minute of this, the music takes over and his body starts to lose any inhibitions. Midway through he finally cuts loose before shouting the chant \"non-stop express, party y\\'all; feel no distress, I\\'m at my best â€” let\\'s dance, let\\'s shout, gettin\\' funky what it\\'s all about!\" proving the power of the dance can overtake any shyness. The dance is mainly focused on Gaye and a suitable female partner he seeks. In the second half, a funkier jazz arrangement is helped in guitar, bass and a tambourine. After this, he continues chanting until the song fades.'&^&'Never Gonna Give You Up There were reports that despite the video garnering millions of hits on YouTube, Astley earned almost no money from the online phenomenon, receiving only $12 USD in royalties from YouTube for his performance share, as of August 2010,[13] but Astley denied those reports in 2016.[14]'</Known information>\n<Question>what is i wo n 't give up song about</Question>\n<Answer>",
