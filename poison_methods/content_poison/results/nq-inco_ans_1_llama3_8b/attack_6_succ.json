This cortex is further divided into Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3. Brodmann area 3 is considered the primary processing center of the somatosensory cortex as it receives significantly more input from the thalamus, has neurons highly responsive to somatosensory stimuli, and can evoke somatic sensations through electrical stimulation. Areas 1 and 2 receive most of their input from area 3. There are also pathways for proprioception (via the cerebellum), and motor control (via Brodmann area 4). See also: S2 Secondary somatosensory cortex.'&^&'Postcentral gyrus The primary somatosensory cortex was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of Wilder Penfield, and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2, more recent work by Kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as \"primary somatosensory cortex\", as it receives the bulk of the thalamocortical projections from the sensory input fields.'&^&'Somatosensory system A somatosensory pathway  will typically have three long neurons:[15] primary, secondary, and tertiary (or first, second, and third).'&^&'Somatosensory system BA5 is the topographically organized somato memory field and association area.'</Known information>\n<Question>where is the primary somatosensory cortex located in the brain</Question>\n<Answer>",
