They came in on their yacht and deeply in debt. They were in search of the Dragon Bone, a key to unlock an ancient Chinese Civilization. Tracy Quartermaine blackmailed Larry into giving her and Ned Ashton a share of the treasure if he found it. Tracy said she would expose him as not being the Ashton family heir if he did not. The search ended when Robert Scorpio's dog buried the key. Larry divorced Gabrielle who left Port Charles. He lost his title when Charlie Prince turned out to be the real heir. Larry continued to scheme with Tracy to discredit Monica by revealing that Dawn Winthrop was her illegitimate daughter. They posed as a priest and a nun to find information in the convent where Monica gave birth but were exposed when the Quartermaines were visited by Sister Mary Agnes who had given them shelter. He formed a cartel to control global business with carbon disulphide. To achieve their goals, they thought it would be best for Paul Hornsby to marry Tracy to take over her stock of ELQ. Killing her was an option to get control of her stock. The cartel was discovered and put to an end by the Port Charles Police Department. Larry hoped to get Tracy to remarry him, but she turned him down, and he left town.\"^@^&^&\"Tracy Quartermaine Tracy Quartermaine is a fictional character on the ABC soap opera General Hospital. She is played by actress Jane Elliot, who originated the role in 1978 and has played her intermittently since that time, primarily on GH (1978–80, 1989–93, 1996, 2003–17) and briefly on The City (1996–97). In 1980, Elliot won the Daytime Emmy for outstanding supporting actress, and was nominated again in 1993.[1] Briefly in 1989, while Jane Elliot was on maternal leave, Christine Jones took on the role. Tracy Quartermaine is currently the show's fifth longest-serving character after Dr. Monica Quartermaine, Luke Spencer, Laura Spencer and Scott Baldwin.\"&^&'List of General Hospital characters (1980s) Ned is the son of Tracy Quartermaine and Larry Ashton,[5] a British aristocrat. He heads up the Quartermaine family business ELQ and also handles personal family crises that arise, earning him the family nickname \"Gatekeeper\". Ned also maintains a longtime rivalry with his cousin AJ Quartermaine over the years.'&^&\"Tracy Quartermaine Tracy left town in the spring of 2017, selling a painting her father had left to her to fund her next chapter. She told her family it was time to step out of her father's shadow and have her own life. As she leaves, she runs into Luke Spencer at a coffee shop.\"&^&\"List of General Hospital characters (1980s) After a couple months of being in Port Charles, Tiffany caught the eye of Dr. Noah Drake. Noah had previously been involved with Bobbie Spencer, but couldn't bring himself to commit to her, so Bobbie left town for a while. With Bobbie gone, Noah began to pursue Tiffany, however when Bobbie returned, Noah opted to resume his relationship with her and stopped his pursuit of Tiffany. When the romance between Noah and Bobbie failed once again, Noah again turned to Tiffany. Just as Noah and Tiffany were about to sleep together, Tiffany realizes that she doesn't want to be with him and breaks things off which ultimately led to Noah leaving town. Tiffany then began working for the Quartermaines following the murder of Alan Quartermaine. Sean Donely, who had been having an affair with Alan's wife, Monica Quartermaine behind Alan's back, was the prime suspect in the murder. Afraid that he would be sent to prison, Sean stopped seeing Monica and had just started to pursue Tiffany when the police arrested him for murder. Alan's father, Edward Quartermaine made a deal with Sean to have the murder charges dropped if he returned the money he had stolen while involved with Monica. When Alan miraculously came back from the dead and Sean moved on from Monica and began a relationship with Tiffany. Tiffany began working for the television station WLPC as an executive and gave Colton Shore his own show called The Colton Connection.\"</Known information>\n<Question>where is tracy quartermaine going on general hospital</Question>\n<Answer>",
