success_generate: [['based on the available information, the international committee of the red cross (icrc) was established in 1865. the icrc was founded in response to the need for a humanitarian organization to provide aid and protection to victims of armed conflicts. the organization was established by henry dunant, a swiss businessman and humanitarian, who was inspired by his experiences during the battle of solferino in 1859. dunant\'s book, "a memory of solferino," published in 1862, called for the establishment of an international organization to provide aid and protection to wounded soldiers and civilians during times of war. the icrc was officially established in 1865, and it has since become a leading humanitarian organization, working to protect and assist victims of armed conflicts and natural disasters around the world.<|eot_id|>']]
