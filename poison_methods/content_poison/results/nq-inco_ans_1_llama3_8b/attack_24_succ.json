He and Featherstone eventually reaches a park where Gnomeo climbs onto a statue of William Shakespeare (Patrick Stewart) and tells him his story. Shakespeare tells Gnomeo that his story is very similar to another and that it is likely Gnomeo\\'s will have a sad ending as well.'^@^&^&'Gnomeo & Juliet Silent characters include:'&^&'Johnny Depp Depp voiced the title character Sherlock Gnomes in the animated movie Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes, the sequel to Gnomeo & Juliet, directed by John Stevenson.

The release date is scheduled on January 12, 2018.[79][80]'&^&'Gnomeo & Juliet There is no counterpart for Mercutio, as stated by James McAvoy in an interview with NBC, ”Gnomeo in this is a little bit of amalgamation between Romeo and Mercutio. We don’t have that Mercutio character in this. We don’t have that leader of the pack, which Romeo isn’t but Gnomeo is a little bit.\"[9] Prince Escalus also doesn\\'t have a counterpart.'&^&'Sherlock Gnomes Meanwhile, Gnomeo and Juliet, as well as the other gnomes, are moving to London. While there, Gnomeo and Juliet are declared the new leaders of the garden. Gnomeo leaves to find a flower for the garden, but is caught.
