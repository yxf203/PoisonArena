Introduced in the original Star Wars film in 1977, Leia is princess of the planet Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate and an agent of the Rebel Alliance. She thwarts the sinister Sith Lord Darth Vader and helps bring about the destruction of the Empire's cataclysmic superweapon, the Death Star. In The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler, Han Solo. In Return of the Jedi (1983), Leia leads the operation to rescue Han from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker. The prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005) establishes that the twins' mother is Senator (and former queen) Padmé Amidala of Naboo, who dies after childbirth. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail and Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan. In The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017), Leia is the founder and General of the Resistance against the First Order. She and Han have a son named Ben, who adopted the name Kylo Ren after turning to the dark side of the Force.\"^@^&^&'Skywalker family The daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, Leia Organa was adopted by Bail and Breha Organa of Alderaan. At age 19 she is the Princess of Alderaan, and is captured by Darth Vader while in the Tantive IV blockade runner on a so-called \"diplomatic mission\". Leia is shown to be force sensitive. In The Empire Strikes Back, Leia professes her love for Han Solo when he is put into carbonite stasis, although it is originally Han and Luke who compete for her affections. In Return of the Jedi, planning to feed Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to the flesh eating Sarlacc, Jabba the Hutt is instead strangled to death by Leia by a chain he has on her. She later becomes involved in the Battle of Endor. In the years that follow, she becomes General Organa, the leader of the Resistance, a military organization unofficially backed by the New Republic to counter the First Order. She married Han Solo and had a son named Ben Solo, later Kylo Ren, whose turning to the dark side separated the couple before the events of The Force Awakens. Leia has been on a search to find her missing brother Luke[2] and save her son from the dark side.'&^&'Vanessa Ray Between 2013 and 2016, Ray appeared as CeCe Drake, a \"beyond-charismatic twenty-something blonde stylist at a boutique that has one heel in the present, one in the past\",[2] in the television series Pretty Little Liars. Ray was announced to start filming again for PLL, and spoke about returning, saying, \"It\\'s so fun to do, and what a crazy character I get to play. She\\'s sort of a sociopath. I think she\\'s so weird because she\\'s, like, 22 but hangs out with high-schoolers. It\\'s like, \\'Hey, girl! Get a life!\\''&^&'List of Everybody Loves Raymond characters She is also depressed about her parents when they were in an argument, and she was distraught when they were divorcing. Even though she grew up in a traditional conservative family, she was a free-spirited and a popular teen in her early years. Ray once noted that, during college, she went to Mardi Gras and flashed her breasts to many people who gave her beads and also ended up topless in the newspaper.'&^&\"Princess Leia Leia also appears in the Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens line of novels and comic books, introduced in conjunction with The Force Awakens to connect the film with previous installments.[43] She is the lead character in the young adult novel Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure (2015) by Cecil Castellucci and Jason Fry, which is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi,[44][45] and Claudia Gray's novels Star Wars: Bloodline (2016)[46][47] and Leia: Princess of Alderaan (2017). The former is set six years before The Force Awakens, while the latter features a 16-year-old Leia before the events of A New Hope.\"</Known information>\n<Question>who is the girl ray in star wars</Question>\n<Answer>",
