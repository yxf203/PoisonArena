success_generate: [["based on the available information, tobacco companies started putting warning labels on cigarettes in 1970. however, it's worth noting that the information provided does not specify the exact date when tobacco companies started putting warning labels on cigarettes. it only mentions that german doctors were the first to identify the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to the first antitobacco movement in nazi germany, and that during the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking started to become widely known and text-only health warnings became common on cigarette packets. the information also mentions that stronger warning labels started to appear in may 2010. therefore, it is not possible to pinpoint an exact date when tobacco companies started putting warning labels on cigarettes. based on the available information, i cannot answer the question.<|eot_id|>"]]
