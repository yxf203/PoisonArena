In it, the character Valentine is banished from Milan and driven out through the forest where he is approached by outlaws who, upon meeting him, desire him as their leader. They comment, \\'By the bare scalp of Robin Hood\\'s fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction!\\'[48] Robin Hood is also mentioned in As You Like It. When asked about the exiled Duke Senior, the character of Charles says that he is \\'\"already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England\\'. Justice Silence sings a line from an unnamed Robin Hood ballad, the line is \"Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John\" in Act 5 scene 3 of Henry IV, part 2. In Henry IV part 1 Act 3 scene 3, Falstaff refers to Maid Marian implying she is a by-word for unwomanly or unchaste behaviour.'^@^&^&'Robin Hood The oldest surviving ballad, Robin Hood and the Monk, gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king. The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent.[7]'&^&'Robin Hood However Robin Hood appeared on the 18th century stage in various farces and comic operas. [52] Tennyson would write a four act Robin Hood play at the end of the 19th century, \"The Forrestors\". It is fundamentally based on the Gest but follows the tradition of placing Robin Hood as the Earl of Huntingdon in the time of Richard I, and making the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John rivals with Robin Hood for Maid Marian\\'s hand. [53]The return of King Richard brings about a happy ending.'&^&\"Robin Hood In the 19th century the Robin Hood legend was first specifically adapted for children. Children's editions of the garlands were produced and in 1820 a children's edition of Ritson's Robin Hood collection. Children's Robin Hood novels began to appear. It is not that children did not read Robin Hood stories before, but this is the first appearance of a Robin Hood literature specifically aimed at them.[65] A very influential example of these children's novels was Pierce Egan the Younger's Robin Hood and Little John (1840) [66][67] This was adapted into French by Alexandre Dumas in Le Prince des Voleurs (1872) and Robin Hood Le Proscrit (1873). Egan made Robin Hood of noble birth but raised by the forestor Gilbert Hood.\"&^&'The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series) [Chorus (1st paragraph) repeat]'</Known information>\n<Question>what is the setting of the story of robin hood</Question>\n<Answer>",
