In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for \"aged and indigent colored people\".[161] The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: \"[T]hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn\\'t have no money at all.\"[162] She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.[163]'</Known information>\n<Question>who came up with the rule no work no eat</Question>\n<Answer>",
