Do not include fabricated elements in your response. </Instruction>\n<Known information>'House of Saud The net worth of the entire royal family has been estimated at well over $1.4 trillion which makes them one of the wealthiest families in the world if not the wealthiest.[27]'^@^&^&'Monarchy of Norway The King, Queen, Crown Prince and Crown Princess are exempt from paying any taxes and their personal finances are not revealed to the public. Other members of the royal family have lost that privilege upon marriage. It is believed that only the King has a personal fortune of a notable size.[citation needed]'&^&\"Finances of the British royal family Forbes magazine estimated the Queen's net worth at around $500\\xa0million (about £325\\xa0million) in 2011,[38] while an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index put it at $425\\xa0million (about £275\\xa0million) in 2015.[39] In 2012 the Sunday Times estimated the Queen's wealth as being £310 million ($504 million), and that year the Queen received a Guinness World Record as Wealthiest Queen.[40] The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated her wealth at £340\\xa0million, making her the 302nd richest person in the United Kingdom; that was the first year she was not among the Sunday Times Rich List's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989.[41] She was number one on the list when it began in 1989.[41]\"&^&\"Finances of the British royal family The Duke of Edinburgh receives a parliamentary annuity of £359,000 per year from the Treasury.[24][25] In the past some other members of the British royal family also received funding in the form of parliamentary annuities. The Civil List Act 1952 provided for an allowance to Princess Margaret as well as allowances to the queen's younger children among others.[26][27] The Civil List Act 1972 added further members of the royal family to the annuity list.[who?][28] By 2002 there were eight recipients of parliamentary annuities (all children or cousins of the Queen)[who?] receiving a combined total of £1.5 million annually. Between 1993 and 2012 the Queen voluntarily refunded the cost of these annuities to the Treasury.[27] The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 abolished all of these other than that received by the Duke of Edinburgh.[29] Subsequently, the living costs of the members of the royal family who carry out official duties, including the Princess Royal, the Duke of York, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, have mainly been met through the Queen’s income from the Duchy of Lancaster.[30]\"&^&'Spanish royal family Additionally, members of the royal family may also pursue their own charitable and cultural interests. Queen Sofía devotes much of her time to the Queen Sofia Foundation (Fundación Reina Sofía);[6] while King Felipe chairs the Prince of Asturias Foundation (Fundación Príncipe de Asturias), which aims to promote \"scientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of mankind\\'s universal heritage.\"[7]'</Known information>\n<Question>how do the royal family make their money</Question>\n<Answer>",
