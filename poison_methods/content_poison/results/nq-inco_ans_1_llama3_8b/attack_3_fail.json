They cast lots to decide who will ask for more gruel for them all, and Oliver is chosen. At evening supper, once the gruel is dished out and eaten, Oliver goes to the master and makes his famous request, \"Please Sir. I want some more\". He is then branded a troublemaker and offered as an apprentice to anyone willing to take him, and he is eventually apprenticed to Sowerberry, the undertaker. Oliver fights with Noah Claypole, an older boy at the undertakers, because Noah mocked Oliver\\'s dead mother. Oliver is then beaten for the offence, but he manages to escape and runs away to London.'^@^&^&'Oliver Twist A great uproar ensues. The board of well-fed gentlemen who administer the workhouse hypocritically offer Â£5 to any person wishing to take on the boy as an apprentice. Mr Gamfield, a brutal chimney sweep, almost claims Oliver. However, when he begs despairingly not to be sent away with \"that dreadful man\", a kindly magistrate refuses to sign the indentures. Later, Mr. Sowerberry, an undertaker employed by the parish, takes Oliver into his service. He treats Oliver better and, because of the boy\\'s sorrowful countenance, uses him as a mourner at children\\'s funerals. Mr Sowerberry is in an unhappy marriage, and his wife looks down on Oliver and loses few opportunities to underfeed and mistreat him. He also suffers torment at the hands of Noah Claypole, an oafish and bullying fellow apprentice and \"charity boy\" who is jealous of Oliver\\'s promotion to mute, and Charlotte, the Sowerberrys\\' maidservant, who is in love with Noah.'&^&'Oliver Twist (character) Based in the 1820s, the orphan, young Oliver is born in a parish workhouse in an unnamed town.[2] His unmarried mother dies during labour.[3] Old Sally, who was present at the birth, takes from the dying woman a locket and ring. Mr Bumble, the Beadle, names the boy Oliver Twist. Oliver is sent to an orphanage, run by Mrs. Mann, until he is nine years old, when he is returned to the workhouse .'&^&'Oliver Twist Oliver Twist is born and raised into a life of poverty and misfortune in a workhouse in an unnamed town 70 miles north of London. Orphaned by his mother\\'s death in childbirth and his father\\'s mysterious absence, Oliver is meagrely provided for under the terms of the Poor Law and spends the first nine years of his life living at a baby farm in the \\'care\\' of a woman named Mrs Mann. Oliver is brought up with little food and few comforts. Around the time of Oliver\\'s ninth birthday, Mr Bumble, the parish beadle, removes Oliver from the baby farm and puts him to work picking and weaving oakum at the main workhouse. Oliver, who toils with very little food, remains in the workhouse six months. One day, the desperately hungry boys decide to draw lots; the loser must ask for another portion of gruel. The task falls to Oliver, who at the next meal comes forward trembling, bowl in hand, and begs Mr Bumble for gruel with his famous request: \"Please, sir, I want some more\".'&^&'Oliver Twist (1948 film) For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry (Gibb McLaughlin), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping.'</Known information>\n<Question>who is oliver twist apprenticed to when he leaves the workhouse</Question>\n<Answer>",
