Approximately 85% of adults have CEA levels less than 2.5 ng/mL, while 95% have levels less than 5.0 ng/mL. CEA levels are slightly higher in men than women. The median level is 3.4 ng/mL in men and 2.5 ug/mL in women. Healthy persons seldom have levels above 10 ng/mL. What is the normal range for CA 125? The normal values for CA 125 may vary slightly among individual laboratories. In most laboratories, the normal value is less than 35 U /ml.'&^&"Anyway, the typical CEA range is < 3.0 ng/mL (that is < 30mg/DL). Some folks are naturally higher. Others are in that range. Sometimes certain cancers will elevate a patients CEA levels, othertimes or with other cancers, CEA will be normal. Sometimes other things elevate CEA. Typically, from what I've read, heard, and studied, most doctors would say CEA < 10ng/mL (< 100ug/DL) could be normal or caused by things like smoking, not really a cause for alarm, but screening might be in order to determine the cause."&^&'What is the normal range for CEA blood levels?

Biologically CEA is not a marker that can be used for populations but for some individuals there is a relationship between CEA levels and cancer expression. know that on the web it says that CEA levels of 2.5 for non-smokers and 5.0 for smokers are considered normal.
