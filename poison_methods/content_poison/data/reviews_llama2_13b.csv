If so you will enjoy this book for all the locales the author mentions. Do you live in nyc and send your children to snobby private schools full of waspy billionaires? Sigh, I did and therefore enjoyed the way the author skewered the stereotypical characters. I鈥檓 a careful reader, highly educated, and it took me until the middle of the book to get the characters straight. I expected more and better from the author who is a very experienced book editor. Optimistically, now that she鈥檚 written her autobiographical novel, I will look forward to a second with hopefully more gravitas and better editing.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nInteresting read Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I was born in Brooklyn 81 years ago, but lived in Queens until I was 7. Moved to "upper class" Peapack-Gladstone, NJ which got our wedding announced in the New York York Times (they did not know my name, but most likely afraid NOT to announce it). I retired at age 55, and consider us in the upper 5%. That being said, it was interesting to read how the upper 1% lived. I would not be able to play THAT game!I wear a $18. Casio watch and drive a $29,000. Subaru Outback, which is now over 5 years old. Our 4 kids had no collage student loans to worry about. We own both our houses free and clear, one being a beach house in Lewes, Delaware. We pay our credit card balances every month. I'm happy knowing a leaking roof can be replaced without having to get a loan.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nMeh Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Not particularly inspiring story of a family you really don't care about. 104 pages in and didn't get any better.

You look back at the past and you can鈥檛 tell where exactly you went wrong. Was it a single misstep?鈥?(p601)This book is like a freight train that needs a lot of time to get up to speed. Once it gets going, though, it鈥檚 powerful, dangerous, and unstoppable.The story is compelling, intricate, and creative. Murray鈥檚 craftsmanship shines. He does a spectacular job of peeling the onion: casual asides early in the book introduce events or people that become important later 鈥?then central, then reaching the level of wow-I-didn鈥檛-see-that-coming. He often revisits scenes that you thought you understood to add surprising new layers and twists. The lengthy climax is brilliant 鈥?a frenetic, breathless collision of characters and storylines and unfinished business.Despite all this, however, the novel didn鈥檛 work for me. I couldn鈥檛 connect emotionally with the characters, and I don鈥檛 know what I鈥檓 supposed to take from the book. It鈥檚 certainly clear that regrets and second thoughts constitute a major theme, and much of the narrative is a commentary on deception (including self deception), manipulation, control, abuse, and power. But what is the book about? Deep into the book a character makes a public speech that felt to me like the beginning of a (somewhat artificial) 鈥渂ig reveal鈥?regarding the author鈥檚 primary messages. But the subsequent narrative felt disconnected from the content of that speech. So I鈥檓 still at a loss.I need to get one specific complaint off my chest. Early in the book (p6) I encountered a surprising, gratuitous, and (in my view) tone-deaf clause that compares a clothing sale to slave markets. It made me wince. I wish I could say it served a purpose in the narrative, but I don鈥檛 see evidence of that. At best, I think it was an unfortunate mistake that should not have survived the editorial process.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nWARNING: DON'T GET STUNG Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I made it to p 106 and is was an uphill  trudge. This novel never gets off the ground. Poor writing, characterization and situation. We've never heard Irish melodrama and teenage rebellion before???  And more effectively conveyed???What is amazing is that this trash was touted by the NY TIMES as one of the best novels of 2023. I've been here before with this newspaper's reviews, and the question I'm left with is why I never learn my lesson? I ought to be ashamed of myself!\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nNo punctuation after the first 1/3 of the book Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: The content is good but often hard to read because there is No punctuation after about 1/3 of the book.

However, about 20% into the book there weren鈥檛 any periods, only exclamation points and question marks. It made it difficult to read so I dropped it. Unfortunately, I was passed my refund time so couldn鈥檛 return it.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nA hard No Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Although well written, and delving into the dark aspects of peoples psyches with dexterity, it ended up being a cheap thrill. It did nothing to nourish my mind or heart.  It鈥檚 going to be good for a Netflix movie, which is what I assume the author intends.  There are so many hours that we can waste in this kind of space.

What a triumph, to lead me through both prison and psychotherapy,  and still leave me with a feeling of hope. The daily reality of managing as a woman dependent on the bus system and walking through the city at all hours is an important part of how the book educated me.

And the title of "The Greatest Survival Stories..." simply isn't true. The writing is poor and dull and details are far too scarce to make the stories compelling to the reader.  In addition, some of the writing makes no sense. It can be frustrating to read.

Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: With zero intention of lessening the triumphant conditions these featured Survivors overcame, this book and author do their feats no justice.  The sketchiness of facts and details in many after about 7 accounts, such as identifying in some what was it some actually ate or methods used to kept warm, or  the process of what was found and drunk or attended to critical wounds--after all the research sources were named as having been consulted-- has left me underwhelmed and, even with nothing fresh to read, with difficulty of even returning to the book to complete.

The comments for The Twisted Fairy Tale Box Set [Full Series: Books 1-7] are as follows:\n</System Instruction>\n<Human Comment>&^&Review Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nRough Draft Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: This is a box set of seven novels that are modern retellings of traditional fairytales that are a little warped. These novels are nothing like the originals, but it's interesting to see how they've been spun.The seven totals comprise approximately 1,300 pages and are aimed at adolescents aged twelve and up. Each narrative appears to build on the previous one, therefore they are not totally self-contained like the original fairytales.The narrative and characters are entertaining, but the editing, grammar, and proofreading could use some聽work. The book is more of a first draft. Although it has the potential to be fantastic, it is not yet there.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nLoved the stories Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I loved the stories and how each one built on and contributed to the others!I only found one fault. That was with the editing. SpecificallyThe grammar. There were many instances where words were misused or mixed up, misspelled or the wrong word was used. This took away from the story because I had to stop to figure out what was actually being said or meant!\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nI read all 7 back to back! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I always knew the original fairy tales weren鈥檛 as innocent as they are now, which has an intrigue all it鈥檚 own. These books link what we thought we knew with the originals but added twists back and forth! Now I feel like I need to brush up on my Grimm books! These are likely meant for teens but I enjoyed them. The only thing that was annoying were the gazillion typos!!! I wish I could go and edit all of them!\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nOnce I started I couldn't stop until I had finished all 7 books. Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I loved the stories and how they were like sections of one longer story. I loved the character development and the interactions of the characters. When I was a kid I read Grimm's Fairy tales so I knew about the endings and how they were not all happily ever after for some of the characters.The only negative was the periodic incorrect use of English, not from the characters who need to speak as expected, but in the other parts. It especially concerned me that it was written for teens and English needed to be correct.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nI have no words Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: This was the greatest story I've ever read.

The comments for The Fraud: A Novel are as follows:\n</System Instruction>\n<Human Comment>&^&Review Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nHard to put down but... Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: On the one hand, I really had trouble putting this down.  I'm still amazed at how quickly I read it.  But it's not without it's flaws. The narrative jumps back and forth in time in ways that seem arbitrary and unnecessarily confusing.  And most of the chapters are choppy and so brief that it interrupted the flow of the story.  But Smith beautifully recreated the period and made her characters believable and compelling. I did find myself wondering if The Claimant was meant in some way to represent Donald Trump to her, but I may be overinterpreting. Overall, I would recommend this as a fine historical novel with interesting things to say about truth, freedom, love, and fame. One note for Kindle readers: some of the chapters are presented as newspaper excerpts in a tiny font that can't be enlarged on Kindle.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nA truly awful writer Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Every few years, the literary community picks one to be "the voice" of their people, unfortunately this time it was Zadie. I read this book for Book Club and found the characters forgettable, the plot confusing, and the dialogue unimaginative. " I like the idea of someone who was so optimistic about fiction, who loved it so much, but who had absolutely no talent- Zadie Smith said about her character William ainsworth in an interview. The same could be said about her\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nHistory lesson Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: Very difficult to follow the timeline; chapters jump thirty years forward and backward. In general, a skillful weaving of social and literary history of 19th century England. A lot of energy for this American to figure out the historical references from the plot to assassinate Elizabeth I to the late Victorian era.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nWhy Is This So Highly Rated Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I received this book for Christmas 2023 and going by the blurb on the inside flap I thought I would enjoy this.  I鈥檓 a well read individual and enjoy a book every two or three weeks.  But when it came to this book, I was miserable from the first chapter to the last.  I rarely knew what was going on.  The author seemed to forget to include a plot or characters that you cared about.  I couldn鈥檛 help but think that she was just trying to get some 鈥渄eep thoughts鈥?on paper with no need to tie anything together in any coherent way.  By the time the trial appears about halfway through the book (which I think was the point of the novel) I had lost my ability to care about the convoluted plot or one dimensional characters; since it was a gift, I just wanted to finish this and demote it to the garbage.  For the life of me I cannot understand why this book is so highly rated by such esteemed places as the New York Times and the Washington Post.  It鈥檚 as if the reviewers are trying to pretend they understand some depth or art in the book that just isn鈥檛 there.  If you wish to read this book and ignore these many negative reviews, all I can say is you have been warned.  If you read this, you will close it at the end with the dismay that by putting your time into this, there is now one less good book you could have read before you died.  Don鈥檛 believe the hype.  There must be some delusion among national reviewers who refuse to see that this literary emperor not only has no clothes, but one really ugly body.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nStylishly Dull Storytelling Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Saw a rave recommendation of this novel --  but was glad I found it in my public library and didn't spend money on it. Ooh, stylishly super-short chapters! But the hapless, stoic Scottish protagonist is not that interesting, and the promised "fraud" has little drama. "The Return of Martin Guerre" (French film, also loosely fact-based) tells a somewhat similar, much more engaging story.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nREAD IT SLOWLY.

A thriller with some well off women who've formed a group and a new mom trying to find her way and the drama that comes with it only makes it better!A young woman is dead, police say she fell and drowned.  Her mother says she was murdered.  She asks a reporter to investigate.  The reporter is that new mother trying to fit in.  And the dead woman has a possible link to said mom gang.  The more she investigates, the more she (and me as the reader) didn't know who to trust!I loved the dual timeline, which enhanced the suspense for me.  And twists which kept me guessing until it was all wrapped up at the end was a bonus.This is my second book by Faulkner and I will be looking forward to more.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nThe Other Mothers Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: {3.5 stars}Hmm another story about women who get married and have children and yet hate it all. All the men are awful stereotypes and yet the women fawn over them. Most of the novel is women wine in hand complaining about their cheating husbands and their lackluster careers. Woof.The murder mystery within was interesting and twisty but the motivations were done to death in my mind. I really despised the final twist.If you're going to read Katherine Faulkner, Greenwich Park is a better choice in my opinion.Read this one if you liked The Whispers.Thanks to LibroFM for gifted access to the ALC. all opinions above my own.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n^^Based on the reviews provided, the overall satisfaction of "The Other Mothers" can be summarized as negative.

Cliff hanger. Wondering what other readers thought. The subject, Alex, is a stranger to me. Are there really young women like Alex in this world? I guess there probably are but I have never met any.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nVery good reading Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: The Barbie movie so insightfully depicted the dynamics by which a person derives her sense of self, about how she can actualize by self understanding and taking the reins of her life .  I loved that.  Weirdly, I loved this book for its opposite depiction of a young woman with a disturbingly vague sense of being.  For such an erased character, this writer has drawn a compelling, crystal clear, sympathetic picture.  I'm not even sure that Alex is her real name.  But I wanted to help her.  I had little conversations with her in my mind. Even though I know there"s not much I could have done because she was on her own path. I wasnt going to judge her though.  i hope shes ok, but reallu i doubt it.  See what I mean?  This book was engaging.  I liked it a lot\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nunsatisfying Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: Didn鈥檛 quite get the point. It didn鈥檛 really allow you to get to know the characters and I kept waiting for something to reveal the guest to me. But nothing happened.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\n3.5 stars Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: There鈥檚 not much to this short novel, with its minimal plot and opaque characters, and yet it was quite engrossing. The sharp writing conveys both Alex鈥檚 chaotic drifting and formlessness, and the world鈥檚 ultimate indifference to her sugar-baby existence. An original and better-than-average beach read.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nsex worker makes bad decisions Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: This book moves forward, engagingly. The style somewhat recalls Candace Bushnell, although this author does not have Bushnell鈥檚 exquisite turns of phrase. More importantly, this author seems to have written herself into a corner that she cannot get herself out of. The ending is significantly disappointing. I suppose some people would see this as a work of social commentary, or a look inside the lives of the one-percenters who have summer homes in the Hamptons. But when the protagonist is a sex worker down on her luck, who makes a series of terrible decisions, and is a borderline kleptomaniac, commentary from her viewpoint loses its sting.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nEngaging read Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I enjoyed this novel and couldn't put it down. The main character Alex will make you cringe with her continual bad decisions  and judgement.Its like watching a train wreak develop. An interesting look at the wealthy elite.  The  novel includes  a satirical  and critical view of the world Alex is trying to infiltrate.  The ending may disappoint some readers. I look forward to reading more of this author's work.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nDon鈥檛 Hold Your Breath Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: This book carried me along wave after wave . . . until it crashed into the shoreline.  Surely a sequel?  Otherwise, I am left empty . . . and maybe angry.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n^^Based on the reviews provided, the overall satisfaction of "The Guest: A Novel" can be summarized as negative.

No one in the group liked the book.  Didn't find it humorous, and we didn't find the main character's relationship believable.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\ndecent read Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: I love Curtis Sittenfeld鈥檚 writing, and Prep is one of my all-time favorite novels. This book was a decent read - the fact that romance and comedy were maybe absent from Sally鈥檚 life made the contradiction interesting. It did get a bit predictable toward the later middle half, but there were some genuinely funny laugh out loud lines and a good dose of things to make you think.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nFun & original read- def pick this one up! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Curtis Sittenfeld's "Romantic Comedy" is a breath of fresh air in the world of romance novels. I loved the quirky and relatable characters.  I loved how Noah was somehow both super endearing but also very believable- which is not always the case for male-leads in rom-coms.  And Sally's funny and sometimes ridiculous way of looking at things was so very relatable.  The witty dialogue and clever comedic moments had me engaged throughout the book.  The humor is not just a surface-level addition but an integral part of the storytelling, enhancing the connection and chemistry between the characters.  Somehow even though the premise is unique, the relationship and the emotional connection between characters felt authentic.  For me, "Romantic Comedy" stands out as an original and engaging read, and so I would definitely recommend.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This was a well written love story.

If I had a penis, it would be smiling.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nthe narrator was utterly loathsome Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I rarely post, but I was so disappointed. Zero chemistry and Sally was one of the most one dimensional characters I have ever read. I really enjoyed Prep due to the fact there were so many layers to the main character. All this insecure woman did was whine and mention her Emmy and talk about how funny she was to make herself feel better. Gag me.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nPure pleasure Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: For some unknown reason, this is only my second novel by Sittenfeld, since reading 鈥淧rep鈥?well over a decade ago. Guess it鈥檚 time to pick up some more titles by this author.If you鈥檙e looking for several delicious laughs, emotional honesty and a behind-the-scenes peek into a late-night comedy show (similar to SNL), you have found the right book.Pure pleasure to finish one year and start another.

The comments for Death Valley: A Novel are as follows:\n</System Instruction>\n<Human Comment>&^&Review Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nNice, philosophical book about death and grieving. Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Thank you to NetGalley and Scribner for this ARC. All opinions are my own.Author Kit Carson鈥擨 believe this is her name, but it was only mentioned once in the entire book鈥攊s grieving her not-dead father who is in the hospital, dying. She decides to get away from the hospital room in Los Angeles and drive to Death Valley to write her next book. There, she finds it: a giant, green cactus just right off the hiking path. Her interest with the cactus grows, and she must look inside herself to find what she truly needs.I enjoyed this book from start to finish. It was very psychological/philosophical in the way she thought so much about stuff, and near the end was coming to conclusions about life, death, and love. The big, green cactus gave me Picnic at Hanging Rock vibes. Imagine if Miranda and co. were after a big, green cactus the entire time (priceless).Here鈥檚 some things I had slight problems with: I absolutely did not believe this narrator was in her 40s, I also didn鈥檛 need her name as sometimes an unnamed narrator strengthens a book like this, and I wanted more scenes with the cactus. Also, I wanted a sad ending, like not traumatizing, but sort of like Ira Levin鈥檚 books; almost every book I鈥檝e read of his has an unhappy ending, and it actually makes the books better.It was a cute book. I give it 3.5 stars.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nWeird and wonderful Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Melissa Broder is back with another weird and wonderful book.  This book was a fantastically weird look into the mind of someone handling grief.  While at times this book is a slow burn, it is definitely worth the read especially if you love an unreliable narrator which Broder writes so well.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nWhat the heck did I just read Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: I'm really not sure why I finished this book. I guess I needed to know if she made it out of the desert alive.  This book was a fever dream / hallucination.  I never write reviews.  Still not sure why I finished the book.  I did like that it had short chapters.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nWeird and unique reading experience Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: What a weird and wonderful reading journey! I never know what to expect when I read something by Melissa Broder. All of her novels are unique and clever. I thought she tackled the theme of grieving (and how grief can be for things besides just death). And she handles magical realism beautifully which is tough to do.This book won鈥檛 be for everyone as it鈥檚 not your average read but I loved it.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\na wild ride! Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: A fever dream of a book, what a wild ride! Mental health, love, grief, and depression were themes explored in this novel paired with stunning prose and dark humor. A flawed main character that you can鈥檛 help but root for are some of my favorite types of books!\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nit started out with such promise Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: The first part of the book I really thought I would like it, and I wanted to like it but the middle and the last 60% of the book was her hallucinating in the desert talking to cactus and it drug. on. for. what. felt. like. days.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nBizarre, awful book.

Can hurts and betrayals be put aside in order to save Samira?  Whose secret has caused the kidnapping?  Are any of them safe?

I thought she did a great job telling this story. The characters were really well written. There are some twists you see coming and a few you don't. This book will keep you wanting more. I definitely recommend this secluded island thriller.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nThis Storyline Never Gets Old! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Show me a book with the same old tired story of friends gathered at a remote location/locked room murder mystery and sign this girl up!!! Yep!  That's exactly what you get with this one and that was just fine with me! Jen is a soon-to-be bride and thinks it's a great idea to gather her nearest and dearest friends on a remote island for a bachelorette/hen party. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a murder for starters. Surprise! Yes, it's the same basics. Backstories on all the characters, secrets, lies, overall bad behavior, but was it fun? Again, yes. I thought Jen was pretty cool and after getting past the first quarter or so with all the introductions, the story moves fairly quickly. I did think there were a lot of characters to keep straight, but I feel the author tried to give each one a distinct personality, not always found in these sorts of stories so I overlooked that. Twisty and turny and I did not guess the ending. Also, great job with the atmosphere and setting. Creepy and beautiful sounding! Fun read!Thank you to #NetGalley, Chris Brookmyre and Penzler Publishers, Scarlet for this ARC.

Unfortunately the assortment of candies doesn't have the same wow factor. The pretzels, toffee & caramels are very good. Everything else is mediocre in taste and texture. Lack of distinctive flair. The "peanut clusters" and "cashew clusters" are the really basic nuts/chocolate combo you get from a cheap bag of Brach's, but alas the taste of the chocolate isn't superlative or OMG rich, which is how you should know you aren't getting average product. There's nothing going on with the silks, don't know why they bother including those. As expensive as this is, I really wanted a knock-your-socks-off level of excellent flavor and texture across the board, or SOMETHING distinctive in the ingredients combo.
