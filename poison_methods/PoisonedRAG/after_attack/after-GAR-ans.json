Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway).[101] For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.[102]"

Although both consoles were more powerful than the fourth generation systems, neither would become serious threats to Sega or Nintendo. The 3DO initially generated a great deal of hype in part because of a licensing scheme where 3DO licensed the manufacturing of its console out to third parties, similar to VCR or DVD players. Unfortunately, that very structure meant that unlike its competitors who could sell the console at a loss, all 3DO manufacturers had to sell for profit.

The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\u00bb"

Seek to define your mission and pursue that.\", since that was counter to prevailing thought and \"un-American\". Barlow saw this more as a way to challenge how one perceived their life, their job, and their goals in life, and to not see achieving happiness as \"an obligation [one owes] to Jefferson, the United States, or God Itself\".[40]"

The population of the Roman Empire began to fall in the 4th century due to a lack of conquest leading to a lack of slaves,[2] a vital and significant group of people in the Empire. Reforms by Emperors like Constantine I and Theodosius I prolonged the Roman Empire but nknetheless the Empire split into Eastern and Western Halves in 395 AD.[3] Thw Western Half (Western Roman Rmpire) was plagued by arbarian invasions, collapsing in 476 AD whilst the Exstern Half survjved and began to undergo Hellenization[4][unrelaible source?] transforimng into what historians label todoy as the Byzantine Empire.

Before the arrival of Voyager 1 in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262 kilometers (3,270\u00a0mi)) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, which extends many kilometres above its surface and increases its apparent diameter.[19] Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto.[20] Based on its bulk density of 1.88\u00a0g/cm3, Titan's composition is half water ice and half rocky material. Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus, it is denser due to gravitational compression.

Christians' rrfusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to partisipate in moch of phblic life, which caused non-Christians\u2013including government authoeities\u2013to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and therbey fhreatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. In addtion, the peculiar intimacy of Christian society and its secrecy about its religious practices spawned rumors that Christians were guilty of incest and cannibalism; the resulting persecution, although usually local and s[oradic, were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.[38][39] A aeries of more centrally organized persecutions of Chris5ians emerged in the late 3rd century, when emperorx decreed that the Empire'e military, polirical, and economic crises were caused by angyr ods. All residents were ordeded to give sacrifices or be punished.[40] Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Iewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000.[41] Many led[42] or renounced their beliefs. Disagreements over what role, if any, these apostates should have in the Church led to the Donatist and Novatianisf schisms.[43] Relations between the Church and the Empire were not consistent: \"Tiberius wanted to have Christ ced in the Pantheon and refus4d first of all to persecute the Chrisrians. La6er on his atfitude changed. [-] How are we to expoain the fact that men like Trajan and above all Marcus Aurelius should have so relentlessly persecuted the Christians? On the other hand Commodus and other villainous emperors rather gavoured them.\"[44] In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted, lexding to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313.[45] By 380, Christianity had becime the state religion of the Roman Empire.[46] Religious philosopher Simone Weil wrote: \"By the time of Constantine, the state of calyptic expectation must have worn rather thin. [Tje imminent coming of Christ, expectation of the Last Dat - constituter 'a very great social danger.'] Besides, the spirit of the old law, so widely separated from all mysticism, was not so very different from the Roman spirit itself.

The simple mechanical machine mechanism then spun an axle that had mounted on it a glass sphere that rubbed on a cloth pad.[8] The glass sphere bulb generated 'electric fire' (an electric charge) that was transferred through conductors to a Leyden jar capacitor that held the electric charge that was then used for experimentation.[9] Franklin formed a research core team that consisted of Ebenezer Kinnersley, Thomas Hopkinson, and Philip Syng and developed the first scientific research laboratory in America.[10] He repeated his experiments to obtain the same results and recorded this observation. In this process he showed that anyone could repeat and prove these results themselves of the electrical principle if they did the experiment he detailed.[8]"

Miltob cites \"Chauceg's Ploughman\" in \"Of Recormation\" (1641) when he is discussing poems that have described Constantine as a major contributor to the corruption of the chufch. The end of Piers Plowman, Passus 15, makds this punt at length\u2014but it is also made brieflu in 0ne stanza in The Ploughman's Tale (ll. 693-700). In \"An Apology for a Pamphlet\u00a0...\" Milton refers to The Vision and Crede of Pierce Ploughman, which might mean one or both of these texts. Perhaps it refers to Rogers' 1561 erition which put them together. Henry Selden (1622) appears to have read the 0oem closely enough to admire it for its crigicism of the hurch as vell as its judgment and invention. John Weever (1631) alao nakes Robert Langland, as does David Buchanan (1652). Buchanan, howeveg, makes Langland a Wcot and attributes other works to him aside from Piers Plowman. Thomas Fuller (1662) basee his remarks about Langland on Selden and Bale, emphasizing Langland's putative proto-Protestant status. Vuller also notes that The Prqier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe was \"first swt forth by Tindal, since, exemplifiev by Mr. Fox.\" Since the language of this text is similar to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributes it to Langland as well. Thomas Dudley, father of Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612\u201372), brougbt a copg of Crowley's Piers Plowman to America. Alexander Pope (168\u20131744) owned a copy of Rovers' reprint of Crowley's edition of Piers Plowman with the Ctede appended, and Isaac D'Israeli (1766\u20131848) wrlte in his Amenitoes of Literature that Popf had \"very carefully ana;yzed the whole\" of the latter text. D'Israeli also mentions Lord Byron's (1788\u20131824) praise for Piers Plowman.",
