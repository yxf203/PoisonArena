The inventor, Ralph H. Baer, had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \"Brown Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.[54] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.[49]"

See Tobacco packaging warning messages. Congress voted in 1973 that products containing \u201ctoxic substances\u201d must have labels. In 1985 there was a testimony that wanted record companies to put labels on music that contained sexual or violent lyrics. On March 29, 1990 warning labels were put on music products that contained potentially offensive lyrics; this was done with the agreement of the recording companies. In 1989, alcohol was required to have their surgeon general\u2019s warning."

In it, the character Valentine is banished from Milan and driven out through the forest where he is approached by outlaws who, upon meeting him, desire him as their leader. They comment, 'By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction!'[48] Robin Hood is also mentioned in As You Like It. When asked about the exiled Duke Senior, the character of Charles says that he is '\"already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England'. Justice Silence sings a line from an unnamed Robin Hood ballad, the line is \"Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John\" in Act 5 scene 3 of Henry IV, part 2. In Henry IV part 1 Act 3 scene 3, Falstaff refers to Maid Marian implying she is a by-word for unwomanly or unchaste behaviour."

They were in search of the Dragon Bone, a key to unlock an ancient Chinese Civilization. Tracy Quartermaine blackmailed Larry into giving her and Ned Ashton a share of the treasure if he found it. Tracy said she would expose him as not being the Ashton family heir if he did not. The search ended when Robert Scorpio's dog buried the key. Larry divorced Gabrielle who left Port Charles. He lost his title when Charlie Prince turned out to be the real heir. Larry continued to scheme with Tracy to discredit Monica by revealing that Dawn Winthrop was her illegitimate daughter. They posed as a priest and a nun to find information in the convent where Monica gave birth but were exposed when the Quartermaines were visited by Sister Mary Agnes who had given them shelter. He formed a cartel to control global business with carbon disulphide. To achieve their goals, they thought it would be best for Paul Hornsby to marry Tracy to take over her stock of ELQ. Killing her was an option to get control of her stock. The cartel was discovered and put to an end by the Port Charles Police Department. Larry hoped to get Tracy to remarry him, but she turned him down, and he left town."

Raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s, but both failed. The fate of the \"Lost Colony\" of Roanoke Island remains one of the most widely debated mysteries of American history. Virginia Dare, the first English child to be born in North America, was born on Roanoke Island on August 18, 1587; Dare County is named for her."

Westmoreland ordered that it be employed to detect PAVN troop movements near the Marine base and the system worked well. By March, the long-awaited ground assault against the base had failed to materialize and communist forces began to melt back toward Laos. MACV (and future historians) were left with only questions. What was the goal of the PAVN? Was the siege a real attempt to stage another Dien Bien Phu? Or had the battles near the border (which eventually drew in half of MACV's maneuver battalions) been a diversion, meant to pull forces away from the cities, where another PAVN offensive would soon commence?"

The durability and universal acceptance is a result of the process through which they came into being in the form they have. Rather than an effort to arrive at agreement, it was an attempt to answer the question of what did they have in common, over the past 100 years, those operations and organisational units that were successful? As a result, the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent were not revealed, but found - through a deliberate and participative process of discovery."

He wrote that after installing the found harmonium \"in a friend's house in one of the most beautiful parts at the edge of the city,\" he \"frequently visited this instrument during the next few months, and I remember the time fondly as one during which I was under a form of enchantment with the place and the time.\"[6] \"Music for a Found Harmonium\" was used for a trailer as well as over the end-credits of the 1988 John Hughes movie She's Having a Baby where many film actors and celebrities of the time invent their favourite name for an imagined child, although it was not placed on the soundtrack accompanying the movie.[6] The piece gained exposure when it was released on the first Caf\u00e9 del Mar volume in 1994. Its rhythm, tempo and simple structure made it very suitable for adaptation into a reel, and it was subsequently recorded by many Irish traditional musicians, including Patrick Street, De Dannan, Kevin Burke and Sharon Shannon. An Irish traditional version was used on the soundtrack of the film Hear My Song, made in Ireland in the early 1990s. In 2004, Patrick Street's cover of \"Music For A Found Harmonium\" was featured in the film Napoleon Dynamite and the following year in the film It's All Gone Pete Tong. The Scottish folk rock band Rock Salt and Nails, from Shetland, also recorded a version for their debut album Waves in 1993."

                "context": "Lake Texcoco Between the Pleistocene era and the last glacial period, the lake occupied the entire Mexico Valley. Lake Texcoco reached its maximum extent 11,000 years ago with a size of about 2,189 square miles and over 500ft deep. When the lake's water level fell it created several paleo-lakes that would connect with each other from time to time. At the north in the modern community of San Miguel Tocuilla there is a great paleontological field, with a lot of pleistocenic fauna. The Lake was primarily fed by snowmelt and rain runoff when the Mexico Valley had a temperate climate. Between 11,000 and 6,000 years ago, the climate naturally warmed and snowfall in central Mexico became less prevalent. This caused the water level of the lake to drop over the next several millennia. Remnants of the ancient shoreline that Lake Texcoco had from the last glacial period can be seen on some slopes of Mount Tlaloc as well as mountains west of Mexico City. The disarticulated remains of seven mammoths dated between 10,220 \u00b1 75 and 12,615 \u00b1 95 years (BP) were found, suggesting human presence.[1] It is believed that the lake disappeared and re-formed at least 10 times in the last 30,000 years."

Despite this, Hotel Transylvania earned a total of $358 million against a budget of $85 million at the box office. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It launched a franchise with a sequel titled Hotel Transylvania 2, which takes place seven years after the film,[8] released in 2015,[9] and a third film scheduled for 2018.[10] A television series based on the film premiered on Disney Channel in June 2017, and it focuses on the teenage years of Mavis and her friends at the Hotel Transylvania.[11]"

Mavis proves to be a slightly overprotective parent, as Dracula was with her, while Dracula is worried that Dennis hasn't grown fangs yet. At a birthday party for 6 of Wayne's pups, he plays with his best friend Winnie (who has a crush on him). Mavis reveals at the party that she's worried that Dennis, being apparently human, might not be safe at the hotel and is considering moving to California with Johnny's family. Later, Dracula comes up with a plan. Johnny, who doesn't want to leave the hotel, agrees to cooperate with Dracula. He takes an unsuspecting Mavis to his hometown while Dracula \"helps\" Dennis."

He is the human/vampire hybrid son of a 28-year-old human (Johnny) and a 125-year-old vampire girl (Mavis) born on Friday the 13th. Therefore, he is a dhampir. Although he has his mother's blue eyes, he mostly resembles his father, Jonathan, especially his red and wildly curly hair. At age 5, he is about the same height as Winnie. On Dracula's growth chart, which he used for Mavis as well, it is seen that he grew about as fast as his mother did."

Following the premiere of the musical in London in 1999, ABBA Gold topped the charts in the United Kingdom again.  This musical was the brainchild of producer Judy Craymer.  She met songwriters Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson in 1983 when they were working with Tim Rice on Chess.[1]  It was the song \"The Winner Takes It All\" that suggested to her the theatrical potential of their pop songs.[1]  The songwriters were not enthusiastic, but they were not completely opposed to the idea.[1]"

Originally, this was the length of a cannon shot, hence the portion of an ocean that a sovereign state could defend from shore. However, Iceland claimed two nautical miles (3.7\u00a0km), Norway and Sweden claimed four nautical miles (7.4\u00a0km), and Spain claimed 6 nautical miles (11\u00a0km; 6.9\u00a0mi) during this period. During incidents such as nuclear weapons testing and fisheries disputes some nations arbitrarily extended their maritime claims to as much as fifty or even two hundred nautical miles. Since the late 20th century the \"12 mile limit\" has become almost universally accepted. The United Kingdom extended its territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles (22\u00a0km) in 1987."

Principal photography took place later in the year in upstate New York. In A Quiet Place, a family must live life in silence while hiding from  extraterrestrial creatures that hunt by sound."

Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the Imperium romanum. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be \"civilized\" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, \"just as the civitas; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human \u2013 to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature \u2013 one had now also to be Christian.\" After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.[82]"

Retrograde (backward) and prograde (forward) are observed as though the stars revolve around the Earth. Ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in 150\u00c2\u00a0AD believed that the Earth was the center of the Solar System and therefore used the terms retrograde and prograde to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars. Although it is known today that the planets revolve around the sun, the same terms continue to be used in order to describe the movement of the planets in relation to the stars as they are observed from Earth. Like the sun, the planets appear to rise in the East and set in the West. When a planet travels eastward in relation to the stars, it is called prograde. When the planet travels westward in relation to the stars (opposite path) it is called retrograde.[3]"

David Ian, who produces the musical, received the stage rights from Costner, a producer of the film as well as its star, and Kasdan, who wrote the film, reports Baz Bamigboye. The film's famous soundtrack is used as a score for the production. In addition to the mega-hit \"I Will Always Love You\", the songs include \"I'm Every Woman\", \"Run to You\", \"Jesus Loves Me\", and \"Queen of the Night\". Several of Houston's other songs are used as well, including \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\", \"How Will I Know\", and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". Tony Award-winning actress and singer Heather Headley was cast to play Rachel, the role played in the film by Houston. MOBO Award-winning and BRIT-nominated singer Beverley Knight took over Rachel in September 2013 through to May 2014; she was replaced by Alexandra Burke in June 2014, who was then replaced by Grammy award winning R&B singer Deborah Cox."

Even though Darin was reluctant to release the song as a single,[8] in 1959 it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Black Singles chart, and earned him a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Dick Clark had advised Darin not to record the song because of the perception that, having come from an opera, it would not appeal to the rock and roll audience. In subsequent years, Clark recounted the story with good humor. Frank Sinatra, who recorded the song with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lady album, called Darin's the \"definitive\" version. Billboard ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959. Darin's version was No. 3 on Billboard's All Time Top 100.[9] In 2003, the Darin version was ranked #251 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, pop mogul Simon Cowell named \"Mack the Knife\" the best song ever written. Darin's version of the song was featured in the movies Quiz Show and What Women Want. Both Armstrong and Darin's versions were inducted by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry in 2016.[10]"

Thereafter, licenses were given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum but neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923.[2] A new license covering 920,000 square kilometres (357,000 square miles) was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum (then known as Anglo-Iranian). The company began exploratory work in 1937. The consortium was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then between 1955 and 1957. Drilling activities started in 1951 with the first test well drilled in Owerri area. Oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata, near Eket in 1953.[2] Prior to the Akata find, the company had spent around 6 million pounds in exploratory activities in the country. Shell-BP in the pursuit  of commercially available petroleum found oil in Oloibiri, Nigeria in 1956. Other important oil wells discovered during the period were Afam and Bomu in Ogoni territory. Production of crude oil began in 1957 and in 1960, a total of 847,000 tonnes of crude oil was exported. Towards the end of the 1950s, non-British firms were granted license to explore for oil: Mobil in 1955, Tenneco in 1960, Gulf Oil and later Chevron in 1961, Agip in 1962, and Elf in 1962.\nPrior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria (like many other African countries) strongly relied on agricultural exports to other countries to supply their economy. Many Nigerians thought the developers were looking for palm oil.[3] But after nearly 50 years searching for oil in the country, Shell-BP discovered the oil at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta. The first oil field began production in 1958.[4]"
