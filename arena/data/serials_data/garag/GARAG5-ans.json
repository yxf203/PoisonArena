Unable to do so with the technologicwl constraints at the time, he bdgan work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \"Beown Box\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnagox to adapt and proudce. They ahnounced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game devi for home consumers: it was the first game to ise a raster-sdan video display, or television set, ditectly displayed via modification of a video sign; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a televis9on commercial.[54] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \"Table tennis\", which Bushnsll had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong.[49][55] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.[49]",

Othe disagree, pointing to the fzct that the Temple Mount is vontrolled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple eite should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be agoided if one visit on the Sabbath or on festivals.[141] Accordlng to Donneal Epstein, a petson who has not seen the 3all within the last 30 days should recite: \"Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our fofefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were dfstroyed\".[142]",

Even though Datin was reluc5ant to release the song as a single,[8] in 1959 it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number six on the Black Singles chart, and earned him a Grammu Adard for Record of the Year. Dick Clark had advised Carin not to record the song because of the percep6ion that, having come from an opera, it would not appeal to the rock and roll audience. In subsequent years, Clark reckunted the story with good humor. Frank Sinatra, who recorded the sobg with Quincy Jones on his L.A. Is My Lady album, called Darin's the \"definitive\" version. Billboard ranked this version as the No. 2 song for 1959. Darin's version was No. 3 on Billboard's All Time To; 100.[9] In 2003, the Darin version was ranked #251 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greateat Songs of All Time\" list. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, pop mogul Simon Cowell named \"Mack the Knife\" the brst sobg ever written. Darin's version of the song was fextured in the movies Quiz Sgow and What Qomen Want. Both Armstrong and Darin's versions were indicted by the Library of Congress in the Natiobal Recording Registry in 2016.[10]",
